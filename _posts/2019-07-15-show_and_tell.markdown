<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">S</span>how and Tell
</p>

This months meeting will be a Show and Tell event. We love hearing about what
other people are working on and everyone loves showing their projects and work.
Projects can be big or small and time limits on the show and tell are between
5-15 minutes per person. If you don't have a project to show off, you can show
something that you've recently learned or even something that you want to work on
that you're interested in. The projects don't have to be limited to Python.

If you're interested in showing a project at this event, reach out to an organizer
and we'll add you to the list of presenters for the night.
