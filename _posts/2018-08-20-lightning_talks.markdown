<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>his month we will be having python lightning talks.
</p>

Sign up to give a quick 5-10 minute talk, we might have room for a 15 minute talk
if you have a slightly longer talk.  Send a message if you're interested.

Here is a list of lightning [talk ideas](https://github.com/pythonsd/presentations/wiki/Talk-Ideas).
You can choose whatever topic you want to talk about, it could even be to ask a couple of
questions to the audience about something you want to find out more about. Talk about a
new library you recently started using. Have fun with it!

Reminder: If you want to give a talk at an upcoming meetup please reach out.
