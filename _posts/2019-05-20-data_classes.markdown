<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">D</span>ataclasses
</p>

Dataclasses are a new feature added to the Python Standard Library in Python 3.7 through PEP 557.

Dataclasses are a code generator, creating boiler plate code for you, simplifying the writing of classes,
particularly ones that are designed to be mutable data stores. Weâ€™ll look at writing our own
dataclasses and the functionality they provide for us.
