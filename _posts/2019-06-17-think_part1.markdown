<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">B</span>eginning to "Think Like Computer Scientists" class w/Dan Mailman
</p>
### ABOUT THE CLASS:

This session is a good starter for Python or programming in general if you want to move on to other languages.
In beginning to "think like computer scientists", we’ll cover:
- Development Environments
- Modules
- Files
- Variables
- Control Flow
- Exception Management
- Input
- Output
- Return Values
- Parameters
- Arguments
- Functions
- Calls

If any of these are mysterious or if you'd like to learn the Python versions, this is your course.
The class will develop and debug several programs that can be built on for more complex tasks.
If there is interest, we'll discuss logistics for learning Computer Vision using Raspberry Pi in the near future.

Come with Python 3 from PYTHON.ORG already installed!*

Email mindstride@gmail.com if you need assistance installing Python
