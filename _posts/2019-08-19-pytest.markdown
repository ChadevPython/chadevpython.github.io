<p class="intro">
<span class="dropcap">T</span>est All the Things with Pytest
</p>

Pytest is a wonderful framework for performing all kinds of testing in python.
From unit testing to complex functional tests, the pytest framework can help!
We will cover an overview of the framework and how to use it, followed by some
lessons learned from using pytest to ensure the reliability of changing
production systems.

Grant Cooksey is a software engineer at Experience and works on building and
scaling data systems. He is an advocate of python and its ecosystem and uses it
from orchestrating infrastructure setup to building data pipelines.
