    Welcome to Chadev Python <br>
    The Chattanooga Developer Python User Group
  </p>
  <p>
    Socialize with us at our monthly meeting where we have presentations on all things python.
    This is a great opportunity to converse with other like minded python enthusiasts to talk
    about projects, problems and techniques. Our meetup is composed of local python developers,
    employers, enthusiasts, hobbyists, students and programmers of many languages. This is a
    place of learning so we welcome all levels of knowledge.
